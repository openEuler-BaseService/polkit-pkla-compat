==========
PolicyKit 0.5 "Urban Living"
==========

Released on August 31st 2007.

This is the third release of PolicyKit. Since 0.4 both source- and
file-format level incomptible changes have been introduced. Accordingly, 
the library so-names have been bumped to reflect this. Porting effort
should be minimal though; see the example in PolicyKit-gnome for details.

WARNING WARNING WARNING: do not use this software in a stable
distribution; there are still security sensitive things that needs to
be audited.
