# Configuration file for the PolicyKit local authority backend.
#
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE, it will be overwritten on update.
#
# To change configuration, create another file in this directory with
# a filename that is sorted after the 50-localauthority.conf and make
# sure it has the .conf extension.
#
# Only a single configuration item, AdminIdentities, is supported. It
# specifies what set of identities to use for administrator authentication.
# The value is a semicolon-separated list of identities. An identity can
# be specified as
#
#  unix-user:<user>
#  unix-group:<group>
#
# where <user> is username/uid and <group> is a groupname/gid. When
# using the group directive, any user in the given group can chosen
# for authentication.
#
# See the PolicyKit documentation for more information about PolicyKit.
