Coding Style
===

 - Please follow the coding style already used - it's not a must, but it's
   nice to have consistency.

 - Write docs for all functions and structs and so on. 

 - All external interfaces (network protocols, file formats, etc.)
   should have documented specifications sufficient to allow an
   alternative implementation to be written. Our implementation should
   be strict about specification compliance (should not for example
   heuristically parse a file and accept not-well-formed
   data). Avoiding heuristics is also important for security reasons;
   if it looks funny, ignore it (or exit, or disconnect).
